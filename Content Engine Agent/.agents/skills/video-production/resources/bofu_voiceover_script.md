### SCRIPT

Every prop firm trader knows the pain. You pay five hundred dollars for a challenge. You trade well. Then one bad day, one news spike, one overnight gap, and you breach the drawdown limit. Challenge failed. Money gone.

Now multiply that by three attempts. Four. Five. The average trader spends over two thousand dollars just trying to get funded.

What if every dollar you spent on a failed challenge came back to you?

That is exactly what Hedge Edge does.

When you open a trade on your prop firm account, Hedge Edge instantly opens the opposite position on your personal broker account. If the challenge fails, your hedge profits recover the fee. If the challenge passes, you keep the funded account and the profit split.

The math is simple. You are covered either way.

Here is how fast the setup takes. Step one, download Hedge Edge and log in. Step two, connect your prop firm MT5 terminal. Step three, connect your hedge broker terminal. Step four, activate hedging. That is it. Ten minutes, and every trade you take is automatically protected.

Hedge Edge runs locally on your machine. Zero latency. No cloud delays. Your trades are mirrored in under one hundred milliseconds. And it works across multiple accounts simultaneously, whether you are running two challenges or twenty.

Five hundred traders are already using Hedge Edge to protect over two million dollars in funded capital. The Starter plan is just twenty nine dollars a month. That is less than six percent of a single hundred thousand dollar challenge fee.

One payout from a funded account covers years of Hedge Edge.

Stop burning money on failed challenges. Start recovering it.
