---

## Segment Overview

| # | Segment | Sale Type | Difficulty | Email Angle |
|---|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| A | Unsuccessful prop trader, unaware of hedging | Pain-driven | Easiest | "Stop Losing Challenge Fees" |

## Platform Strategy by Segment

### Segment A — Unsuccessful Prop Traders (Unaware of Hedging)

**Size estimate**: Largest segment. 85-90% of FTMO's 3.5M+ customers have failed at least one challenge. Most have never heard of hedging as a risk mitigation strategy for challenges.

**Where they are**:

| Platform | Specific Locations | Filtering Signal |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **YouTube** | Comments on "I failed FTMO" videos, challenge failure compilations, "why I quit prop trading" content | Commenters expressing frustration, asking "how do I stop losing fees?", mentioning multiple failed attempts |
| **Reddit** | r/Forex, r/PropFirm, r/FuturesTrading — failure threads, "is it worth it?" posts | Posts with keywords: "failed challenge", "lost $X on fees", "how many attempts", "FTMO failure", "can't pass phase 1" |
| **Linkedin** | Connecting with "Prop firm employees" and scraping emails |
| **Twitter/X** | FinTwit, prop firm hashtags (#FTMO #PropTrading #PassedOrFailed) | Tweets about failing, asking for tips, commenting on challenge results |
| **Telegram** | SE Asian & Middle Eastern prop firm groups (English & local language) | Groups with 1K-50K members focused on prop challenges. Very active, high failure discussion volume |

**Content strategy**:
- **Hook**: "85% of prop traders lose money on challenge fees. Here's how the top 5% recover it."
- **Format**: Short-form (TikTok/Reels/Shorts) showing fee calculator — "How much have you spent on failed challenges?"
- **Lead magnet**: Free Hedge Guide PDF + fee recovery calculator
- **CTA**: Waitlist signup → triggers Segment A email sequence

**Filtering criteria** (for ad targeting & organic outreach):
- Follows prop firm accounts but NOT hedging/risk management accounts
- Engaged with challenge failure content
- Joined prop firm communities < 12 months ago (newer = more frustrated)
- Located in English-speaking markets + SEA + Middle East
- Age 18-35 (Gen Z/Millennial prop firm demographic)

---

### Segment B — Successful Prop Traders (Unaware of Hedging)

**Size estimate**: ~5-10% of prop firm customer base. Smaller than Segment A but higher value — already funded, higher willingness to pay for tools that protect their income stream.

**Where they are**:

| Platform | Specific Locations | Filtering Signal |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **YouTube** | "I passed FTMO" celebration videos, payout screenshot compilations, scaling plan discussions | Creators and commenters sharing success, payout amounts, discussing how to stay funded |
| **Discord** | Funded-trader channels in prop firm Discord servers (#funded-chat, #payouts), exclusive funded trader communities | Members sharing payout screenshots, discussing drawdown management, scaling strategies |
| **Reddit** | r/Forex funded trader flair, r/PropFirm success posts, r/Daytrading | Posts with keywords: "got funded", "first payout", "scaling plan", "drawdown worried" |
| **Twitter/X** | FinTwit funded trader community, payout screenshot shares | Tweets with FTMO certificates, payout receipts, "funded" in bio, 📊🏆 emoji patterns |
| **Telegram** | Funded trader signal groups, premium trading channels | Smaller, curated groups (100-5K members) where members have active funded accounts |
| **Prop firm leaderboards** | FTMO Wall of Fame, public leaderboards, TradingView verified accounts | Traders publicly showing funded performance |

**Content strategy**:
- **Hook**: "You passed the challenge. But 1 bad week can wipe the funded account. Here's how to protect it."
- **Format**: Case study — "How a funded trader lost $200K account to a news event — and how hedging would have saved it"
- **Lead magnet**: "Funded Trader Risk Calculator" — shows your monthly payout vs cost of losing the account
- **CTA**: Waitlist signup → triggers Segment B email sequence

**Filtering criteria**:
- Follows prop firm accounts AND engages with success/payout content
- Has posted or shared funded account evidence (certificates, payouts)
- Member of premium or funded-only communities
- Engages with risk management content (trailing stops, drawdown)
- Higher income signals (willing to invest in tools)

---

### Segment C — Knows About Hedging, Doesn't Do It

**Size estimate**: Small but highly convertible. These traders have been exposed to hedging content but decided not to act — usually due to perceived complexity or cost.

**Where they are**:

| Platform | Specific Locations | Filtering Signal |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **YouTube** | Comments on hedging tutorial videos, prop firm strategy videos that mention hedging | Commenters saying "interesting but too complex", "sounds good in theory", "not worth the hassle" |
| **Reddit** | Hedging discussion threads in r/Forex, r/PropFirm; "is hedging worth it?" posts | Users who've commented on hedging posts with objections: "spreads eat profits", "too complex", "not enough capital" |
| **Discord** | Trading strategy channels where hedging has been discussed; users who asked about it once and didn't follow up | Members who engaged in hedging conversations but never adopted — identifiable via search in server history |
| **Twitter/X** | Threads discussing hedging strategies that got engagement but also pushback | Users who retweeted/liked hedging content but never posted about doing it themselves |
| **Trading forums** | BabyPips, ForexFactory, Elite Trader — hedging discussion threads | Users with posts in hedging threads expressing interest but citing barriers |
| **Telegram** | Strategy discussion groups where hedging has been debated | Members who engaged in hedging debates on the "against" side or "undecided" side |

**Content strategy**:
- **Hook**: "You already know hedging works. Here's what changed that makes every objection obsolete."
- **Format**: Objection-destruction content — "4 reasons traders don't hedge (and why they're all wrong in 2025)"
- **Lead magnet**: "Hedging Objection Buster" — side-by-side comparison with real numbers
- **CTA**: Waitlist signup → triggers Segment C email sequence

**Filtering criteria**:
- Has engaged with hedging content (viewed, commented, shared)
- Expressed objections publicly (complexity, cost, capital requirements)
- Follows trading strategy accounts (not just prop firm accounts)
- More sophisticated trader profile (longer account age, more technical posts)
- May follow trade copier / EA accounts (interested in automation broadly)

---

### Segment D — Active Hedgers (Manual)

**Size estimate**: Smallest segment but highest conversion potential for paid tiers. Already doing the thing — just needs a better tool.

**Where they are**:

| Platform | Specific Locations | Filtering Signal |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Discord** | Hedging-specific discussion channels, EA/bot development channels, trade copier communities | Members actively discussing manual hedging setups, sharing their MT5 configurations, asking about execution speed |
| **YouTube** | Hedging tutorial creators' communities, trade copier setup videos, EA configuration guides | Viewers who comment with specific technical questions (lot sizing, execution latency, swap costs) |
| **Telegram** | Trade copier groups (Social Trader Tools, Duplikium), manual hedging strategy groups | Members sharing their manual hedge setups, discussing broker execution quality, comparing tools |
| **Reddit** | r/algotrading, r/Forex (hedging-specific threads), EA/bot development posts | Users who have posted about their own hedging setups, asked for tool recommendations |
| **MQL5 / trading tool forums** | EA marketplace, trade copier reviews, MetaTrader forums | Users who've purchased or reviewed hedge-related EAs, or asked about automating their manual process |
| **Twitter/X** | #AlgoTrading, #TradeCopier, automated trading accounts | Users tweeting about their manual hedging workflow, complaining about execution speed |

**Content strategy**:
- **Hook**: "You already hedge manually. What if it took zero effort and was 50x faster?"
- **Format**: Side-by-side comparison — manual workflow vs. automated (with timing data: 2-5 sec vs <100ms)
- **Lead magnet**: "Manual vs Automated Hedging Benchmark" — execution speed, recovery rate, error rate comparison
- **CTA**: Waitlist signup → triggers Segment D email sequence

**Filtering criteria**:
- Has posted about manual hedging (specific technical language: "lot sizing", "hedge ratio", "swap costs")
- Uses or mentions trade copier tools (Social Trader Tools, Duplikium, Local Trade Copier)
- Follows EA development / automation accounts
- Active in MT5/MT4 technical communities
- Higher technical sophistication (developer/quantitative background)

## Segment Tagging Strategy

**How to determine which segment a lead belongs to:**

### Option 1: Source-Based Auto-Tagging
Map the acquisition source to the segment:
- UTM parameter: `?utm_segment=unsuccessful_unaware`
- Referral source tracking: which Discord channel, subreddit, or video they came from
- Ad campaign targeting already segments the audience

### Option 2: Landing Page Quiz (Recommended)
Add a 3-question micro-quiz to the waitlist signup:

1. **"Have you traded with a prop firm?"** → Yes/No
2. **"Have you passed a challenge?"** → Yes / No / Haven't tried yet
3. **"Are you familiar with hedging prop challenges?"** → Never heard of it / I've looked into it / I actively hedge

| Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | → Segment |
|----|----|-----|-----------|
| Yes | No | Never heard | **A** — Unsuccessful, unaware |
| Yes | Yes | Never heard | **B** — Successful, unaware |
| Yes | Any | Looked into it | **C** — Aware, not hedging |
| Yes | Any | Actively hedge | **D** — Active hedger |

### Option 3: Behavioral Auto-Tagging
After signup, analyze:
- Which content they arrived from (UTM tracking)
- Which links they click in the welcome email
- Discord channel behavior (if they join)

## Priority Channels (Ranked by ROI)

| Rank | Channel | Effort | Cost | Reach | Best Segments |
|------|---------|--------|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **Discord** (own + partnerships) | Med | Free | High | All |
| 2 | **YouTube** (own + creator partnerships) | High | Low-Med | High | A, B |
| 3 | **Reddit** (organic + targeted comments) | Low | Free | Med | A, C |
| 4 | **TikTok/Reels/Shorts** (pain-point content) | Med | Free | High | A |
| 5 | **Twitter/X** (FinTwit engagement) | Low | Free | Med | B, C |
| 6 | **Telegram** (group infiltration) | Low | Free | Med | A, D |
| 7 | **Prop firm review sites** (SEO content) | Med | Free | Med | A, B |
| 8 | **MQL5/Trading forums** (technical content) | Low | Free | Low | D |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Add `segment` field to Supabase profiles table** — stores the tag from quiz or UTM
2. **Build the 3-question landing page quiz** — auto-routes to correct segment
3. **Set up UTM tracking** — map campaign → segment for ad traffic
4. **Create segment-specific lead magnets** (4 PDFs / calculators)
5. **Launch Discord partnership outreach** — 5 prop firm servers with 10K+ members
6. **Create first YouTube content piece** — "How Much Have You Spent on Failed Challenges?" (targets Segment A)
7. **Seed Reddit content** — r/PropFirm educational posts about hedging (targets A & C)
